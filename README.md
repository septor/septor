### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Patrick. I enjoy developing odd projects mostly for personal use.

My current favorite project is [Tumult](https://github.com/septor/tumult). I also continue to dig deeper into Flutter.

If you live in the lower Michigan area (~20 miles on either side of Interstate 69), my wife bakes amazing things. [Try some](https://tastytreatsbytia.com/).
