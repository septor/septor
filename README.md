### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Patrick. I enjoy developing odd projects mostly for personal use.

My current favorite project is [Tumult](https://github.com/septor/tumult) (which I'm rewriting, progress not ready for public), though I've put more work into my [Gallery](https://github.com/septor/pepperprintthis) script lately.

I also continue to dig deeper into Flutter. I'm toying around with Godot as well.

To be fair, most of my time is sunk into getting my shit kicked in (zombies are ruthless) playing [Project Zomboid](https://projectzomboid.com/).
